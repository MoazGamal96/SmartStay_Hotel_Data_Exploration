Project Objectives
  •	Clean and prepare the hotel booking dataset for analysis.
  •	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in bookings, cancellations, revenue, and guest segments.
  •	Build KPIs and visualizations to measure performance (ADR, cancellation rate, RevPAR, occupancy proxies).
  •	Create an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau) showcasing key insights and recommendations.
  •	Package analysis, visualizations, and documentation in a polished GitHub repo for portfolio use.

Project Scope
  •	Data preprocessing and cleaning (missing values, date parsing, outliers).
  •	EDA: univariate, bivariate, time-series, and segmentation analysis.
  •	Feature engineering: total nights, total guests, lead time bins, stay type.
  •	Optional modeling: cancellation prediction & booking forecasting.
  •	Dashboard & report: Power BI/ Tableau deliverable + slide deck 
  •	Documentation: README, data dictionary, methodology, and lessons learned.
